# Shubai-s-Dissertation-Codes

Hi,

This site include all the final codes for my project. The mixed-type data clustering models are built with R, and all others are with built with Python. The workflow is the training and test data firstly processed in Python. Then with the processed training and test data as inputs to build mixed-type clustering models in R. With the data saved from R codes, we train and test the XGBoost.
